# Telco Customer Churn Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
Customer churn is a major concern for telecom companies, as retaining existing customers is often more cost-effective than acquiring new ones.  
This project focuses on analyzing **customer churn data** using machine learning and visualization techniques to identify the key factors that drive churn and to build predictive models.

The objectives are:
- Understand customer behavior through exploratory data analysis (EDA).
- Identify important factors contributing to churn.
- Build predictive models to forecast customer churn.
- Provide insights that can help businesses reduce churn rates.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- **Programming Language:** Python 3  
- **Libraries Used:**  
  - Pandas, NumPy – Data preprocessing & manipulation  
  - Matplotlib, Seaborn – Data visualization  
  - Scikit-learn – Machine learning modeling  
  - Jupyter Notebook – Development environment
